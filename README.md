# Gazhal
UniqueSiteShowcase

This is a showcase of a unique, non-standard website. It is an example piece to show that i understand UI/UX design and i can make functional websites that are more than just the same old beginner projects.
This was my 2nd ever website, i've imrpoved since then.
This example is just to showcase something to potential future employers.
Flask was used here instead of NodeJS and React because of its simplicity and quick prototyping abilities. This can be ported over to NodeJS if required.

(A gazhal is a type of hindi/urdu poem, analysing a gazhal requires complex algorithms and exception clusters)
